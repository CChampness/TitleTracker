This app is a handy way to browse books on Google books and save titles for your own personal reference.
It uses a GraphQL interface to access the Google Books API search engine.  Also employed are the MERN stack
with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. Users can save book searches
to the back end for later reference from any connected device.  This is a full-stack app which
is deployed on Heroku.
